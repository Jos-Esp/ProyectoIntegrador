# ProyectoIntegrador
School project about creating a system for Mexico City's airport.

The program will read the two files and update the informations about the clients by creating a new txt file before exiting the program. The user can choose a preferred airline, or date, and the programm will show a preview of the flights of the chosen airline or the chosen date. It is possible to easly change the informations about the flights in the "aerolinea.txt" file but, since this is not a full programm and just a school project, it is not possible to add more than five flight per airline at a time. The programm will let create as many clients as the users wants with their own names, emails and passwords, and they each have their own point system according how much kilometers they made.
